Release history for nhkd

v22.01  2022-01-15
  [Fixed]
  - Reset handler of SIGCHLD to SIG_DFL before launching new processes.
    On some systems, the handler was retained as SIG_IGN (even after
    exec()), so the programs we launched were missing SIGCHLD signals,
    which, in turn, can lead to all kinds of bizarre errors.

v20.06  2020-06-20
  [Fixed]
  - Minor: Some tabs sneaked into the source code, because this project
    is based on dwm. They have been replaced by four spaces.

v20.05  2020-05-24
  - This is the initial release of nhkd.
